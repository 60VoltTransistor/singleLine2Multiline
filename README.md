# singleLine2Multiline

Just a simple python script that takes a string of text that you want to be strung across multiple lines of text. I created this because I wanted to keep a note in notepad++ and the wordwrap feature included with notpad++ doesn't wrap text around onto its own line, so this breaks it up so I can still have nice evenly spaced lines and line numbers.

~~Also a better way to do this to make the resulting word lengths would be to wrap it into a formated ouput, then you could do away with manipulating a list and what not, I may make that change in the future, but for now it works, and the word length isn't too abhorrent.
Also the only downside to the original method is that all words have varying lengths, so determining lines by the number of words per line leads to a disproportionate disrobution of line lenghts, the better way to do this to wrap the input it into a formated ouput, where the formatted output would limit the width of the output string, this would result in a more uniform output and would look nicer, not to menthion you could then do away with manipulating a list and what not. I may make that change in the future, but for now it works, and the word length issue isn't too abhorrent.~~

*Made the code better, you should be able to see the changes made in the history, and the code should perform better than the old version of the code.*
