# singleLine2Multiline

Just a simple python script that takes a string of text that you want to be strung across multiple lines of text. I created this because I wanted to keep a note in notepad++ and the wordwrap feature included with notpad++ doesn't wrap text around onto its own line, so this breaks it up so I can still have nice evenly spaced lines and line numbers.
